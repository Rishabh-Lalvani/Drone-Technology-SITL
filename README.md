# Drone-Technology-SITL
In this repository, we are going to be using two projects:
The first project is controlling a drone in SITL (Software in the loop) by using gesture recognition and the second is controlling a swarm of 3 drones in SITL.
Note that the only components required for SITL in Windows is Mission Planner by Ardupilot and some Python libraries like Pymavlink, Mediapipe, etc.
